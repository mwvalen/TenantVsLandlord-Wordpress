Allows you to insert ads after paragraphs of your post content.

Content ads get the best click through rate. If you want to increase your CTR and Google AdSense revenue, then you need to start adding ads within your post content. 

Insert Post ads allow you to automatically insert ads after paragraphs of your post content. This saves you the hassle of manually entering ads in each of your post.
