Allows manual selection of a 'main' category for each post for better permalinks and SEO.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to select a main category for your posts for better permalinks and SEO.

The chosen category is shown in bold on the 'Posts List' page and the 'Post Edit' page. You can select a different permalink category on the 'Post Edit' page using the 'Categories' box (hover over the categories and click on 'Permalink' to select one, then save your post).

ABOUT WOOCOMMERCE AND CUSTOM TAXONOMIES SUPPORT

Previously, specific WooCommerce support was introduced in a Pro version. This support will be continued in an external plugin (= a different plugin) developed by Yaniv. The current Pro customers will be contacted by Yaniv in order to switch to this new plugin. WP Category Permalink will be upgraded in a different way. It will not focus on WooCommerce specifically but will add support for custom taxonomies in general. Don't worry, this upgrade will be smooth and is a good move for everyone. There will be two plugins of quality available for custom permalink with different purposes :)

Languages: English.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-category-permalink.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Please ask your questions in the forum and I will add them here :)

= I donated, can I get rid of the donation button? =
Of course. I don't like to see too many of those buttons neither ;) You can disable the donation buttons from all my plugins by adding this to your wp-config.php:
`define('WP_HIDE_DONATION_BUTTONS', true);`

== Screenshots ==

1. Pick the category you'd like to have for the permalink.
